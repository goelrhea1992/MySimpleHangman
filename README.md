# MySimpleHangman

As part of my Introduction To Programming course, during my first year at IIIT- Delhi, I created a simple console game of Hangman. It truly helped me appreciate the beaufitul language of Python. 

It's very simple as it picks a word randomly from a text file, and allows a user 3 + length of the word number of guesses. And the score is computed based on the number of incorrect guesses before the player finds the word.

This code essentially will help any novice Python programmer to get some idea of how powerful the language is.
Disclaimer: There is no OOPs used here. So, it really is for beginners looking to get a hold of the language.
